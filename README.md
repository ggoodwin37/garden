The Garden of Life and Death
===========

A simple ecology sim.

#### TODO: general
- `gulp less` automatically

#### TODO: terrain
- how do we handle redrawing terrain during game loop? can we cache the bitmap? or another layer?

#### TODO: up next
- make sure we have good abstractions for game map vs. bitmap
- hook up to game loop
- start in with living creature architecture:
  - game loop/managers
  - common and specific animal state and naming. creature? plant, herbivore, carnivore? phc?
  - gene interface and naming
- think more about concept of color-based adaptation system.
- sketching out a creature's behavioral state machine is a good way to figure out what genes we need.
